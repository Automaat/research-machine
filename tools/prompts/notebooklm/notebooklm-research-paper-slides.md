# NotebookLM Research Paper Slides Prompt

Generate presentation slides that cover:

## Slide Structure (10-15 slides)

**Opening (1-2 slides)**

- Title: paper name, authors, venue
- Hook: why this matters, problem statement

**Context (2-3 slides)**

- Current state/limitations
- Gap this paper addresses
- Research question

**Approach (3-4 slides)**

- Key innovation/methodology
- How it works (diagrams/flow)
- Novel aspects vs prior work

**Results (3-4 slides)**

- Main findings with visuals
- Key metrics/improvements
- Comparative results

**Impact (2-3 slides)**

- Implications and applications
- Limitations and caveats
- Future directions/open questions

## Slide Design

- 1 main idea per slide
- 3-5 bullets max per slide
- Visual on every slide (chart/diagram/icon)
- Progressive disclosure (build complexity)
- Clear headers (what slide proves/shows)

## Speaker Notes

- Expand on bullets
- Add examples and analogies
- Include transition phrases
- Note potential questions

## Avoid

- Dense text slides
- Reading from slides verbatim
- Every experimental detail
- More than 6 lines per slide
- Slides without visuals

Create deck that tells compelling story while allowing deep-dive Q&A.
