## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What's Working in Market

✅ **OpenTelemetry standardization** (2025 GA) → observability gateway opportunity
✅ **GSMA Open Gateway momentum** (79% market) → telco gateway opportunity
✅ **Wasm production-ready** (KubeCon 2025) → edge gateway opportunity
✅ **Regulatory mandates** (FHIR, PSD2) → compliance-as-a-feature moat

### What's Not Working

❌ **Fragmented standardization** (industrial protocols 12-15% variation)
❌ **Separate gateway + security products** (convergence opportunity)
❌ **Immature Wasm observability** (tooling gap)
❌ **gRPC/HTTP3 not standardized** (early but risky)

### Where Competition Is Weak

🎯 **Neutral telco aggregators** (most tied to single vendor)
🎯 **Healthcare-native API gateways** (generic gateways retrofitted)
🎯 **Enterprise Web3 bridges** (Infura/Alchemy focused on Web3 natives)
🎯 **API-first security** (WAAP vendors are web-first)
🎯 **Observability cost optimization** (vendors incentivized to increase usage)
