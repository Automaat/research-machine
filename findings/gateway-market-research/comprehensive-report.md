### 📊 8. Observability Gateway (OpenTelemetry)

**Market Size:**

- $2.9B (2025) → $6.1B (2030), 15.9% CAGR
- API Gateway Observability: $3.36B by 2029

**Market Drivers:**

- OpenTelemetry reached full maturity (2025)
- GA status: metrics, traces, logs
- Cost crisis: Companies spend 10-20% of infrastructure costs on observability
- 60-80% cost reduction potential through sampling/filtering

**Deployment Patterns:**

- No-collector (direct)
- Agent collector (per-host)
- Gateway collector (centralized hub) ← opportunity

**⚠️ Architectural Challenge:**

- Kong Gateway positioned at **edge** (north-south traffic)
- Observability data generated **internally** (east-west traffic)
- **Gap:** Kong doesn't naturally see internal service telemetry

**Three Potential Approaches:**

**1. Kuma Service Mesh Integration** (Strongest)

- Kong owns Kuma (CNCF service mesh)
- Kuma handles east-west traffic
- Unified observability gateway for Kong Gateway + Kuma
- Complete coverage (edge + mesh)

**2. Standalone OTel Distribution** (More Realistic)

- Kong Observability Gateway = Enhanced OTel Collector (not extra layer)
- Similar to AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, Grafana Agent
- Works independently of Kong Gateway
- Value: Enterprise management UI + cost analytics + support

**3. Kong Ingress Controller** (Limited)

- Some customers use Kong internally too
- But not universal (~30-40% of customers)

**Business Opportunity for Kong:**

- **Primary:** Standalone enterprise OTel distribution (broader TAM)
- **Secondary:** Kong ecosystem integration (upsell to existing customers)
- **Value:** Cost optimization (60-80% reduction), enterprise UI, support

**Key Differentiation vs Vanilla OTel:**

- Enterprise management UI (vs YAML-only)
- Cost analytics dashboard (real-time savings visibility)
- Business-rule sampling engine (per-customer, per-API)
- Multi-tenancy built-in
- Enterprise SLA

**Competition:**

- Cribl, Mezmo (observability pipelines)
- Vanilla OTel Collector (free but DIY)
- Grafana Agent, Splunk OTel Collector (other distributions)

**⚠️ Risk Factors:**

- OTel Collector "good enough" for many
- Market already has strong competitors (Cribl, Mezmo)
- Value proposition = "better Linux" play (enterprises pay for convenience)
- Requires excellent execution to justify price over free OTel

**Revised Assessment:** Still viable but **lower conviction** than initially assessed. Product
must REPLACE OTel (not add layer), deliver clear cost savings, and provide significantly
better UX to justify enterprise pricing.

---

#### **🎯 C. Observability Gateway (OTel Distribution)**

**Why:** $6.1B market by 2030, observability cost crisis (10-20% of infra spend), OTel
maturity (2025)

**⚠️ CRITICAL CAVEAT:**
Kong Gateway at edge (north-south) but observability data from internal services (east-west).
**NOT a natural fit.** Three options:

1. Kuma integration (service mesh handles east-west) - requires Kuma adoption
2. Standalone OTel distribution (works independently) - broader TAM but no Kong synergy
3. Kong Ingress (internal APIs) - limited to ~30-40% of customers

**Recommended Approach:** Standalone enterprise OTel distribution (REPLACES vanilla OTel, not
extra layer)

**What Kong Actually Ships:**

- Enhanced OpenTelemetry Collector (like AWS ADOT, Grafana Agent)
- Kong Konnect UI management (no YAML)
- Cost analytics dashboard (real-time savings)
- Business-rule sampling engine
- Multi-tenant configuration
- Enterprise support/SLA

**Key Features:**

- Multi-backend routing (Datadog, New Relic, Grafana, Splunk, Dynatrace)
- Intelligent sampling (60-80% cost reduction)

- Cardinality management

**Differentiation vs Vanilla OTel:**

- Enterprise UI (vs YAML-only config)
- Cost visibility built-in (show savings in $)
- Operational simplicity (1-2 FTE → 0.2 FTE)
- Support/SLA

**Differentiation vs Cribl/Mezmo:**

- Optional Kong Gateway integration (API-aware telemetry)
- Unified control plane (if using Kong ecosystem)
- Open-source OTel foundation (vs proprietary)

**GTM:**

- **Primary:** Companies with high observability spend ($500K+/year) - not just Kong customers
- **Secondary:** Upsell to existing Kong + Kuma customers (unified observability)

**⚠️ Risks:**

- Vanilla OTel "good enough" for many teams
- Cribl, Mezmo already established
- "Why pay for free software?" objection
- Requires excellent execution to justify premium

**Revised Priority:** Consider moving to **P2**. Market is more commoditized than initially
assessed. Telco and FHIR gateways may be better P1 candidates (less competition, clearer
differentiation).

**TTM:** 6-9 months (not 3-6) - need robust enterprise features to justify price
